# A user inputs a number say 32 , and a position say 7.

# write a function which takes the number and sets its 7th position counting from least significant digit and then return the resultant number in decimal.

# Example-32â€™s binary representation is 00100000 and after setting its 7th position from least significant position,

# the resultant number becomes: 01100000,which is 96.
