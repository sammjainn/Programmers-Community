## Given preorder of a binary tree, calculate its depth(or height) [starting from depth 0]. The preorder is given as a string with two possible characters.

- ‘L’ denotes the leaf
- ‘N’ denotes internal node

## The given tree can be seen as a full binary tree where every node has 0 or two children. The two children of a node can ‘N’ or ‘L’ or mix of both.
