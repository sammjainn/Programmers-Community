## Consider lines of slope -1 passing between nodes (dotted lines in below diagram). Diagonal sum in a binary tree is sum of all nodeâ€™s data lying between these lines. Given a Binary Tree, print all diagonal sums.

For the following input tree, output should be 9, 19, 42.

```
                              1
                              
                2                             3
                
       9                6           4                   5
       
            10      11          12      7
            
            
9 is sum of 1, 3 and 5.
19 is sum of 2, 6, 4 and 7.
42 is sum of 9, 10, 11 and 12.
