# Given two sorted arrays, a[] and b[], the task is to find the median of these sorted arrays, in O(log n + log m) time complexity, when n is the number of elements in the first array, and m is the number of elements in the second array.

# Constraints

- 1 < size Of Array <= 10^6
- 0 < Array Elements <= 10^9

# Input

- Array
- Its Size

# Output

- return Median of the two Sorted Arrays

```
Input: ar1[] = {-5, 3, 6, 12, 15}
        ar2[] = {-12, -10, -6, -3, 4, 10}
Output : 3

Input: ar1[] = {2, 3, 5, 8}
        ar2[] = {10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20}
Output : 11.
