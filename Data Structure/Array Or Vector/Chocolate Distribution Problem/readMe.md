##### 1.Each student gets one packet.

##### 2.The difference between the number of chocolates in packet with maximum chocolates and packet with minimum chocolates given to the students is minimum.

# Constraints

- 1 < size Of Array <= 10^6
- 0 < Array Elements <= 10^9

# Input

- Array
- Its Size
- No. of childrens

# Output

- Print the Minimum difference between the m packets
