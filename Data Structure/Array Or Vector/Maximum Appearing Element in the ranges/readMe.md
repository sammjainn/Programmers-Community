# Given n ranges of the form L and R, the task is to find the maximum occurred integer in all the ranges. If more than one such integer exists, print the smallest one.

# Constraints

- 1 < size Of Array <= 10^6
- 0 < Array Elements <= 10^9
- 0 <= Li, Ri < 1000000.

# Input

- Array
- Its Size

# Output

- return maximum occuring element in the ranges

```
Input : L1 = 1 R1 = 15
        L2 = 4 R2 = 8
        L3 = 3 R3 = 5
        L3 = 1 R3 = 4
Output : 4

Input : L1 = 1 R1 = 15
        L2 = 5 R2 = 8
        L3 = 9 R3 = 12
        L4 = 13 R4 = 20
        L5 = 21 R5 = 30
Output : 5
