# Given an unsorted array of positive integers, find the number of triangles that can be formed with three different array elements as three sides of triangles. For a triangle to be possible from 3 values, the sum of any of the two values (or sides) must be greater than the third value (or third side).

# Constraints

- 1 < size Of Array <= 10^6
- 0 < Array Elements <= 10^9

# Input

- Array
- Its Size

# Output

- return the number of triangles

```
Input: arr= {4, 6, 3, 7}
Output: 3

Input: arr= {10, 21, 22, 100, 101, 200, 300}.
Output: 6
