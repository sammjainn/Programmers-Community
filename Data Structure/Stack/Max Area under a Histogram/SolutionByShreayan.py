AUTHOR: github.com/shreayan98c

LOGIC:
1. The h-index is calculated by counting the number of publications for which an author has been cited by other authors
at least that same number of times.
2. First sort the citations list in reverse order.
3. Now traverse the reverse sorted list of the citations - At each index, it will give us a track of how many
publications have been counted yet and what is the number of citations at the current index.
4. If our number of publications that have been counted is greater than the current citation, we will be incrementing
the result by 1 since the current publication has to be included in the h - index.
5. Return the total number of the publications counted in the previous step.

COMPLEXITY:
Time Complexity: O(n), n is the length of the bars in the histogram.
Space Complexity: O(n), one list/stack is created or stored in the memory.
