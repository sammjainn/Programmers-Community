## Given an array arr of N integer elements, the task is to find sum of average of all subsets of this array.

```
Input  : arr[] = [2, 3, 5]
Output : 23.33 
Explanation : Subsets with their average are, 
[2]        average = 2/1 = 2
[3]        average = 3/1 = 3
[5]        average = 5/1 = 5
[2, 3]        average = (2+3)/2 = 2.5
[2, 5]        average = (2+5)/2 = 3.5
[3, 5]        average = (3+5)/2 = 4
[2, 3, 5]    average = (2+3+5)/3 = 3.33

Sum of average of all subset is, 
2 + 3 + 5 + 2.5 + 3.5 + 4 + 3.33 = 23.33
```
