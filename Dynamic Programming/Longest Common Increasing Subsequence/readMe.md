## Given two arrays, find length of the longest common increasing subsequence [LCIS] and print one of such sequences (multiple sequences may exist)

```
arr1[] = {3, 4, 9, 1} and
arr2[] = {5, 3, 8, 9, 10, 2, 1}

Our answer would be {3, 9} as this is the longest common subsequence which is increasing also.
```
